### Project Details 
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (with urls or IPFS file CIDs included) at following :

* Mockups/designs of any UI components
* Data models / API specifications of the core functionality

### Ecosystem Fit 

Help us locate your project in the Crust landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? Decentralized storage for a web 3 social network
* What need(s) does your project meet? User content storage needs
* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the IPFS/Crust ecosystem? Not the same as Evrylife
  * If so, how is your project different? https://docs.evrylife.org/evrylife-foundation-wiki-docs/docs-and-resources/new-decentralized-social-media-or-what-sets-evrylife-apart
  * If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems? orbis.club and lens.xyz can be seen as similar, but only in part. There is room in this space for many social applications to emerge and share market share.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to IPFS/Crust. We *recommend* that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month. 

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone, and include the approximate number of days along with the cost per day.
* _Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory_ and shall not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's `Additional Notes` section (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Required workload of a full-time employee for the whole project (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent)) (e.g. 2 FTE)
* **Total Costs:** Amount of payment in USD for the whole project. The total amount of funding *needs to be below $30k*  (e.g. 12,000 USD)

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Crust Order Modules 
* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  2
* **Costs:** 8,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Crust nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. | 
| 1. | Crust module: X | We will create a Crust module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone) |  
| 2. | Crust module: Y | We will create a Crust module that will... |  
| 3. | Crust module: Z | We will create a Crust module that will... |  



### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features

* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  1
* **Costs:** 4,000 USD

...

This section I cannot create in great detail as we need milestone 1 to be achieved first. I hope you can see past this part and see that the project is very serious.

Upcoming Milestone 1 is take on advisors and developers to help consult the planned tech stack/app architecture. (cost $5000) (1-2 month)
Milestone 2 is to begin building the MVP and also the smart contract for the fair launch round 1 (5% of tokens released to help funding). Crust Network decentralized storage integrations at user level along with Ceramic Network are top priorities and are planned currently to be in MVP (cost $60,000)(time 3-6 months) This stage is to raise hopefully around 200,000 to 400,000 in funding to help fund later milestones.
Milestone 3 is to complete the MVP and align it with the fair launch round 2 (35% of tokens released, remainder are placed in community treasuries, and ILP), ILP pool begins here as well with staking and rewards. (this stage costs are included in the above $60,000, founder will be funding marketing initiatives here as well through team donations. (The fair launch round 2 will hopefully also raise 2m-4m which will help to bring the app to stable community version.)
Milestone 4 is to continue building app in modular fashion with code audits at each release, new integrations would include new decentralized storage options, new mod tasks, and upgraded features. Crust Network is a priority as it is the best fit for the Evrylife application needs. (cost 1,000,000 estimate covered by fair launch rounds and team donations and fundraising efforts)
Milestone 5 is to introduce dao main version of app with community governacen hand off, The community will then be able to evolve the application through community app improvement proposals

## Future Plans

Please include here

- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term, and
- the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.

Many community growth strategies will be used. In the short term their will be keyword seo articles released related to web 3 social.decentralized social app etc. KOLs and content creator project reviews and collaborations, potential airdrop for early username sign ups and guilds for particiapation in fair launch rounds. As the app is released content creation strategies at geo location levels and specific content types strategies will be implemented.
